In computer networks and web services, HTTP status codes are used to indicate the status of a request made by a client to a server. 

These codes are divided into categories based on their first digit:

- **1xx (Informational)**: These status codes provide information about the request and are rarely used in practice.
- **2xx (Success)**: These status codes indicate that the request was successful.
- **3xx (Redirection)**: These status codes indicate that further action is needed, often in the form of a redirect.
- **4xx (Client Error)**: These status codes indicate that there was an error with the client's request.
- **5xx (Server Error)**: These status codes indicate that the server encountered an error while processing the request.

Here are some common HTTP status codes and their meanings:

### 2xx (Success)
- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource has been created as a result.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return in the response.

### 3xx (Redirection)
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found**: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a new URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request, so the server is returning no content.

### 4xx (Client Error)
- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required, and the client has not provided valid credentials.
- **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

### 5xx (Server Error)
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected error while processing the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server while processing the request.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unavailable (e.g., due to maintenance or overload).

These status codes help clients understand the outcome of their requests and provide insights into the state of the server or the request.
