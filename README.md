# Sentiment Analysis with BERT Neural Network

## Overview

This project utilizes the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis. BERT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model that excels in understanding context and nuances in text. The sentiment analysis task involves predicting the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a given piece of text.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed before running the code:

- Python 3.x
- Transformers library from Hugging Face
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the backend you choose for Transformers)

```bash
pip install transformers
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-bert.git
cd sentiment-analysis-bert
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
```

4. Run the sentiment analysis script:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

5. Enter the text you want to analyze when prompted.

## Project Structure

- `sentiment_analysis.py`: The main script for sentiment analysis.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for easy installation.

## Data

The model has been trained on a dataset containing examples of text labeled with sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral). You can fine-tune the model on your own dataset for domain-specific sentiment analysis.
